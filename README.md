There's a good heart and ...
A layer of dark clouds covering the light
Strong layer by layer off the camouflage
The past vehicles cover the eyes inside the panic fragile
By the corners of the mouth of the smile mercilessly wounded  
A heart inside a person 
A person but only a heart 
When you come back and forth trampled on my heart
I am not afraid of pain afraid of you love not firm
A person to eat a person to sleep
A person miss a person drunk 
One person love the other 
A person tears , a good sorrow
I am a small fish 
Never thought to escape 
I also love sea
I also want to breathe 
But the thought of abandoning you
I would rather dry up in your broad palm
I'm alone 
I'm alone I'on my own
I'm alone 
I'm dreaming of me alone
I'm alone or happy or sad don't who cares about me
I a person crazy I know me a person 
How much want to go back to know that you are not behind 
The love to the end only left me
I go alone (let me go alone)
Don't say love me again (I don't want you to love me)
Let go (really let you go)
From then on one person let me go alone 
I don't want you love me really let you a person good )
else:
     I miss you
